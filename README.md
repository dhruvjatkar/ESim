# ESim
ESim is an open source simulation template for anyone who wants to simluate anything from virus growth to environmental stress factors. (My first project using C# in Unity)

# Usage
When you pull and open the repository, the simulation is ready to go population-maintaining entity called entity1. The Entity Behavior Script can be manipulated to add or delete behaviors. As of now, they eat red flowers to maintain their hunger, and reproduce once. Any of these behaviors can be easily edited.
